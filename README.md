Greetings!

Welcome to my first ever project for data analyst and my first ever step into the data field. There are 4 documents in this repository
*Case-Study-1
*Presentation-Findings
*CSV-Files
*Project-Guidelines-Instructions

The case study file is a document that highlights the exact steps Ive taken to reach the findings I have produced and used in the presentation file. It has all the SQL queries code that I had used to filter and find specific datapoints used in the tableau visualization.
The presentation and findings pdf is my findings and what I wouldve presented to stakeholders with the inclusion of tableau visuals.
The CSV folder have the CSV file I had used in my BigQuery SQL queries.
Project-guidelines-instructions was the original guideline provided by coursera and google themselves.

Thank you for dropping by!
